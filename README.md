Freshworks â€“ Frontend Assignment

Country Explorer

Project Link: http://country-explorer.000webhostapp.com/

Build a web application that helps you find information about any country and display them. You
are free to design the experience of this app to your personal tastes.

Functional requirements:

1. The first page should have a search bar on top that should be used to search for any
country by making an API call. You can use APIs from https://restcountries.eu/.
2. The search results should be displayed on the same page as cards with the name and the
flag of the country, without refreshing the web page.
3. On clicking a card, the app should redirect to a page that shows country details. Display
all interesting details that are returned by the API. You are free to design this page as you
see fit.
4. The details page should have a link to go back to the previous page, where the search
results were displayed.

Non Functional Requirements:

1. The web app should be written in HTML, JS, and CSS. We would like you to build the
app without using any web frameworks (e.g, React, Angular, Vue, Jquery etc).
2. The pages should be responsive.
3. Avoid using bootstrap. Use CSS media queries instead.
4. API calls should be made using the fetch API (https://developer.mozilla.org/enUS/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).
5. Clean code and comments are highly appreciated.
6. Bonus points for good error handling.
7. Bonus points for adding interesting features as well.
